figure out the Class[] hack in DP::Message.

g_pDisplay

static charsets in DcrTrades_t.
overall, clean up Dcr* of charset cruft

DcrWindow.cpp, remove inline code from .h

widget IDs as empty enum class + constexpr + MakeId
review some of the enable_if/concepts ideas for restricting MakeId to specific types (WindowId_t, WidgetId_t, EventId_t, etc.)

c++20: * == done(ish)
	range_for (as_const? or just const auto) whereever const_iterator is defined. read up on as_const vs. const auto
	public + delete instead of private copy/assignment/move
	enum class
	constexpr
		static const -> constexpr
