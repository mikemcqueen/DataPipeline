LoNTrader (Legends of Norrath Trader) is a personal project I created and worked on during the 2006-2009 timeframe, approximately. It's a Windows C++ application (~35,000 lines) for automated trading of digital trading cards in the Legends of Norrath digital trading card game. Legends of Norrath has since been shut down, so I figured I'd put the code online for no particular reason, other than to pique or satisfy the curiousity of the curious.

LoNTrader uses the "DataPipeline" framework, which is a lightweight multi-threaded data-processing framework that I wrote along with this application, and have used for other applications. The Data Pipeline consists of three states: Acquire, Translate, and Execute.  

For LoNTrader, the Acquire handler was a separate thread that would take screenshots of the application every second or so, and queue those up for the Translate handler. The Translate handler would look at each bitmap, and using "DCR" or digital character recognition (also custom built, and part of this package), or matching other small source bitmaps, would determine what the contents of the screenshot wer, whether it had an "game text" on it, and, for example, where buttons or text fields were that could be interacted with. It would package up this "translated data" and push it to the Execute handler, where an action or command would be excuted. For example, identification of a Login screen bitmap would result in Username and Password being entered into their respective fields, and the "Login" button being clicked (which would then result in a new image appearing in subsequently acquired images from the Acquire handler, and the cycle continues).
