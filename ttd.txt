lon::window_t::  should probably become lonwindow namespace
with manager_t type
   get rid of static methods

add event:: namespace
	event types inside this



see if i can remove ZeroMemory versions of Data_t everywhere.  Not sure what circumstances require this, if any.

figure out the Class[] hack in DP::Message.
