lon::window_t::  should probably become lonwindow namespace
with manager_t type
   get rid of static methods

add event:: namespace
	event types inside this

TransactionManager_t::ExecuteTransaction const TxData

figure out the Class[] hack in DP::Message.

g_pDisplay in LonTraderImpl.

SSTask::Acquire::Data_t has a virtual destructor to release pool item. destructor i understand.  why does it need to be virtual?

the whole TrSurface_t -> TrWindow_t (no template type) -> TrTable_t -> ?? inheritance heirarchy looks bad

static charsets in DcrTrades_t

typedef SsTrades_t::ScreenShotData_t TranslateData_t; is in several files in the TrSurface -> TrWindows -> Tr?? heirarchy. looks unnecessary.

c++17:
	range_for (as_const? or just const auto) whereever const_iterator is defined. read up on as_const vs. const auto
	delete instead of private copy/assignment/move
	* (done-ish) override instead of virtual for all derived virtual functiond decls
	nullptr instead of NULL
